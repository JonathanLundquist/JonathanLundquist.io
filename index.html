                   <span>Hello, my name is Jonathan Lundquist. I am a web design and developer. I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2021, with a degree in Web Design and Development.</span>
                   <span>I was born in Tacoma, Washington, before moving to Rexburg, Idaho, in order to attend school. I currently live in Chyenee, Wyoming with my wife, and two pets.</span>
                   <span>Outside of my work, I have a passion for history, and computers. I built my first computer when I was fourteen years old, before the self built computer scene took off. I studied history in college for 3 years, before making the switch to WDD.</span>

                <p>
                    My current project is a soundboard website, for the hit game, “League of Legends”, by RIOT gaming. The purpose of this website is to allow users that come to it, to select their favorite character or champion, as the characters are known by in game, and play their dialogue lines whenever they want. Soundboards are incredibly popular in the online community, and especially in the gaming and voice communications communities. Furthermore, there are currently no dedicated soundboards on the market for League of Legends, free or otherwise. This game achieved 23 million unique viewers during its annual championship in 2020, and 115 million unique players throughout the year of 2020. Needless to say, there is a market or a target audience for this kind of website.
